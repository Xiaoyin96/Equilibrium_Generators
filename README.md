# Generate Boltzmann equilibrium state using deep learning

## This is the code for group 44 in ECE 228.
- Main code for InvNet is in deep_boltzmann folder, which is adapted from the original paper.
- Visualization of training and testing for 3 models is in notebook folder.
- For particles model, simulating data takes a long time, thus we pre-generated particles.npz in data folder.
